                <p>
                    As I develop this from an experiment into a finished project, I will replace the numbers with illustrations of the different elements highlighted by the sounds. I'll also work on fading the audio in and out.

                <p>
                    Listen to the wind sounds adding! With each section on this page, the corresponding sound gets added to the song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here I'll draw some little wind symbols. I'll also add some seagull sounds to the audio.

                <p>
                    Here I'll draw a little wooden ship. Can you hear the wood creaking?

                <p>
                    I'll draw some little leaves swirling around the rocks.

                    After all the sounds are added in, the full picture is revealed.

                <p>
                    Try scrolling back up to hear the sounds disappear!
