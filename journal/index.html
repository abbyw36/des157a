            <h2>Entry 1 - Form Design</h2>

                Good form design draws on human behavior and psychology to create intuitive, efficient forms that improve user retention. Well designed forms allow a user to swiftly move through it, and they minimize clicks (interaction costs) while maximizing understanding.

            <p>
                UX designer Salim Ansari has a great article (<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>) that goes into some of these strategies a little deeper. He emphasized keeping the flow of the form linear and showing the user roughly how much they have left if there are multiple pages. I would love to use this idea in my projects, because I find forms that seem to go on indefinitely (without telling me my progress) to be very frustrating.

                I was surprised that he warned against using inline input field labels. I usually think that these look very clean, aesthetic-wise. However, he mentions that once a user starts typing in this field, they can no longer see the label. This makes reviewing the form at the end harder for the user. In my designs, I’ll have to weigh how much I value aesthetics vs. efficiency when designing elements like this.

            <h3>An example of good form design</h3>
            <p>One of my best and easiest experiences filling out a form was the <a href="https://eligibility.navvyai.com/form?link_uuid=c1784bfe-ae21-446e-b9a4-141a53262bfe">SNAP eligibility estimator</a> from the Student Basic Needs Coalition. I love its clean design, clear information hierarchy, and progress bar at the top. The web designers also made sure to put labels outside of the form fields so users do not forget what category they are answering.</p>
